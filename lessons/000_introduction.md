# Welcome!

Here is the plan for today's first lesson in bioinformatics.

1. Welcome + code of conduct (https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/) (5m)
   1. Alternating weeks: Data analysis (today) vs sequence analysis (next week)
2. Get Spreadsheet of data (5m)
   1. Download the
      [`17_Plate_Concentrations.xlsx`](https://github.com/czbiohub/learn-bioinformatics/blob/master/data/17_Plate_Concentrations.xlsx?raw=true)
      file.
   1. Open it in Excel.
   2. Ashley will explain what is happening :)
4. [Data Carpentry - Spreadsheets - Intro](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/00-intro/) (15m)
5. [Software Carpentry - Unix Intro - Navigating files and directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/) (15m)
6. [Software Carpentry - Unix Intro - Working with files and directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/) (15m)
7. CCC - Jupyter notebook intro (5m). Point to the excellent [Jupyter User's
                     Guide](https://athena.brynmawr.edu/jupyter/hub/dblank/public/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb)
   from Bryn Mawr College.
8. CCC - Plate reader output in excel vs python (10m)


## CCC Plate reading instructions

1. Make a folder in your home directory called `~/code/`
1. Change to that directory (`cd ~/code`)
2. Make another folder called `cupcakes-coffee-coding`
3. Change to the CCC folder
4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook from this folder with the command `jupyter
   notebook`
