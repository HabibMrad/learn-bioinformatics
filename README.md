# learn-bioinformatics

List of resources for learning bioinformatics, from beginner to advanced. The
audience of this list is people who have the desire to get started learning
programming and bioinformatics tools but aren't sure where to start.


## Absolute Beginner

This is for people who may still be "afraid" of the command line and want a
gentle introduction.

- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) - Introduces
  Unix command line (bash shell), Python, R, Git, SQL for reproducible
  programming and research. Can be done on your own or you could attend a
  [2-day workshop](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/) near you!
- [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) - Introduces
  OpenRefine, R, SQL for data analysis and structure. Can be done on your own
  or you could attend a
  [2-day workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops/) near you!

## Beginner

This is for people who feel ready to hit the ground running

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)
- [Python for Biologists](https://pythonforbiologists.com/) - Teaches
  everything an intro Python course would teach, but frames everything in terms
  of biological questions.
- [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) - List of problems that
  build on each other in complexity, starting from calculating GC content to
  assembling genomes!
- [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython)
- [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) - Interactive R programming courses in the
  R console

## Intermediate
